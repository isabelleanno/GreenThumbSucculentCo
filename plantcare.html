            shapes. Getting one for your household will surely add a unique
            flare to any living space, indoor or outdoor.

            need, such as lighting and soil conditions. We’ll go over how much
            you should water them, and other kinds of maintenance required to
            keep your plants thriving. Lastly, we will talk about common issues
            with your plant and how to resolve them. By the end of this article,

          <p>
            Like any other plant, succulents need three things to be happy: Good
            soil, the right amount of water, and adequate sunlight. They differ
            from your average houseplant, though- since they are from
            demi-desert environments, they thrive under those conditions.
          </p>
          <h2>Soil & pot</h2>
          <p>
            Ideally, succulents need a pot with a drain on the bottom. They
            don’t like sitting in water. If you don’t have a pot with a drain,
            putting large pebbles or rocks at the bottom of the pot is a good
            alternative. They like coarse, sandy dirt that has lots of
            nutrients. You can find great cactus mix here or you can make your
            own with two parts sand, one part perlite, and three parts peat moss
          </p>
          <h2>Water</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents have evolved to need minimal amounts of water, and they
            like to store any water they can get. That’s why overwatering them
            can kill them - they store too much water in their leaves and turn
            to mush. In contrast, under-watering your plants will cause the
            leaves to turn yellow or brown and shrivel up. Watering twice a
            month at the roots will keep them happy and healthy.
          </p>
          <h2>Light</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents need a lot of light, but they don’t need blasting sun all
            day. Too little light will cause them to stretch out and become
            “leggy.” Too much light can burn them or stress them. Stressing a
            succulent causes their leaves to turn orange or red. This doesn’t
            harm the plant. Most succulents need 4-6 hours of sunlight a day.

          <p>
            Caring for cacti or succulents is quite easy in general, but they
            have different needs based on the exact genus and species you’re
            caring for. Popular succulent genera include echeveria, kalanchoe,
            aloe, crassula, haworthia and aeonium. Make sure you know what
            you’re buying and research each genus accordingly as their needs may
            differ.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you live in a rainy climate, your succulents might get too much
            water outside, and will do better in a greenhouse or your home.
            Overwatering is fatal and easy to do, hence it’s the most common way
            we see succulents die. Bring your plants inside for the winter!
            Succulents mostly grow and bloom in the warmer seasons, and too much
            exposure to frost can kill them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If your house is getting a little less sunlight than you want,
            moving them outside for the summer will do them good- just make sure
            you don’t give them too much sunlight. Plant food or fertilizer can
            help enhance their growth.

          <h2>Water & soil issues</h2>
          <p>
            Too much water makes the leaves translucent, squishy, or yellowish.
            Too little water makes the leaves dry, wrinkled and crunchy. Rot can
            be caused by soil that retains water for too long. A rotting plant
            will be limp and have brown on its stem. Rot usually starts at the
            root. In general, repotting the plant in the proper soil and
            adjusting how much you water it could fix this issue. If rot is in
            an advanced stage, you may have to chop off the stem and roots. Wait
            for your plant to grow new roots before repotting.
          </p>
          <h2>Sunlight issues</h2>
          <p>
            Too much sunlight will burn the leaves. They will get dry, flaky and
            crunchy. Too little sunlight causes your succulent to grow tall and
            lanky. The leaves spread out. This is your plant’s way of looking
            for sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reviving a plant with sunlight issues can be difficult. Damage is
            usually irreversible- your plant won’t look the same again. Most
            succulents can be propagated, so try picking off the most healthy
            leaves and growing them again from scratch.
