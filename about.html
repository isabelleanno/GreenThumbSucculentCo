          <p>
            Over 100 years ago in 1907, my great grandparents made this
            greenhouse in their backyard in San Angelo, Texas. The ambition was
            to create the perfect enviromnent for exotic fruits and vegetables
            that are hard to grow in this climate. Unfortunately, the scorching
            summer heat mostly squandered these bountiful harvests that they had
            hoped for, drying them to a crisp.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The sun was no match for my stubborn family. Determined to grow
            beautiful things, they transformed the greenhouse into a perfect
            nursing ground for cacti and succulents. Those plants thrived in
            there, and over the years, they mastered the art of growing these
            gorgeous desert plants. Instead of giving up on their gardening
            endeavors completely, they turned their greenhouse into a local
            business, and blessed the nearby townsfolk with a marvelous variety
            of new houseplants. Their plant business took off and slowly but
            steadily grew. Then in 1964, their daughter- my grandmother- took
            over this local family business and eventually relocated to Phoenix
            Arizona. She transformed her house into the shop, and lived
            upstairs.

            passed down to myself and my husband, as well as our baby- a corgi
            puppy named Oscar. He's the unofficial mascot of our store, such a
            good boy- he will happily greet you when you enter! Our shop is
            booming, it's doing fantastic.
